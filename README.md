This project is a lap counter system for the Formula 1 motorsport sport. The system requests input with the driver's name and the interaction of the "start" of the lap count and "stop".
This computed data is saved in a list. The list is ordered from fastest to slowest lap.
The Vue.js framework and typescript functions were used in the project.
